SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

** convention **
SQL doesn't require you to write the keywords(SELECT、FROM、WHERE ..) all capitalized, but as a convention, it helps people distinguish SQL keywords from column and tables names, and makes the query easier to read.


Lesson 1
SELECT column, another_column FROM which_table
<!-- 顯示 which_table 裡的 column 跟 another_column 欄位資料 -->

SELECT * FROM which_table
<!-- 顯示 which_table 裡的 *(所有) 欄位資料  -->


SQL Lesson 2: Queries with constraints
<!-- Id  Title Director  Year  Length_minutes
1 Toy Story John Lasseter 1995  81
2 A Bug's Life  John Lasseter 1998  95
3 Toy Story 2 John Lasseter 1999  93
4 Monsters, Inc.  Pete Docter 2001  92
5 Finding Nemo  Andrew Stanton  2003  107
6 The Incredibles Brad Bird 2004  116
7 Cars  John Lasseter 2006  117
8 Ratatouille Brad Bird 2007  115
9 WALL-E  Andrew Stanton  2008  104
10  Up  Pete Docter 2009  101
 -->
SELECT title, year FROM movies
WHERE year <= 2003;
<!-- 顯示名字、年份，條件是前五部發行的作品 -->
SELECT title, year FROM movies
WHERE year
BETWEEN 1995 AND 2003

SQL Lesson 3: Queries with constraints (case-insensitive case-sensitive)

SELECT * FROM movies
WHERE title LIKE "%WALL%"
<!-- Find all the WALL-* movies -->
<!-- Id  Title Director  Year  Length_minutes
9 WALL-E  Andrew Stanton  2008  104
87  WALL-G  Brenda Chapman  2042  97
